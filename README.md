## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to build a project with tailwind from scratch without reference to any videos, only using the docs. I also learned how to use the cleanuri api to shorten links.



### Continued development

Build more projects using tailwind css.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This docs helped me when I got stuck on how to implement certain styles. I really liked the documentation and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/) - This is an amazing course by Brad Traversy where he teaches tailwind in an hands on way.
